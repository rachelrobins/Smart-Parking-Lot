Instructions on how to use the simulation:
1. You can press the scenario buttons in order to invoke a scenario.
2. While the random scenario is running you can press the commands' buttons
   to invoke events.


Notes regarding the simulation:
0. When you start the simulation the random scenario is running. 
   Also, when a scenario is done, random scenario is automatically invoked.
1. When switching to scenario 4 and from scenario 4, the executor is re-created.
   Therefore, it takes a bit longer.
2. When switching to and from other scenarios (not scenario 4)
   we clean the board by fast-forwading the simulation.
3. When invoking  an event (by pressing a button), current state first gets finished
   and only then the event can occur.
