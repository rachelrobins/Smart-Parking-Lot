Parking Lot project has begun.

Main things we have done:
1. We created a simple spectra file that controls the parking lot gates. 
1.1 We declared variables for both the gates(system) and the cars(enviroment)
1.2 We added an assumption regarding the car in queue. Which means - if a car wants to enter the 
	parking lot it will not just disappear.
1.3 We added 2 main gurantees regarding the gate. Which means if a car wants to enter or exit
	the parking lot the appropriate gate will eventually open.
1.4 We have set the initial state of the gates to be closed.

2. We created the first scenario - a car enters the parking lot, parks the car and then exits.
2.1 We have created the background and animation of the parking lot.
